1.1 Is Unique? -> Implement an algorithim to determine if a string has all unqiue characters?
Follow up question -> What if we cannot use any additional data structures?

Input:

Initial thought here is to use a set - this takes care of the duplicate characters.
Follow up - we can first sort the string - then loop through checking the current letter and the letter next to it

"""
1.4 Palindrome Permutation -> Given a string, write a function to check if it's a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards
    Ex - "racecar" -> the same forwards and backwards
A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.
    Ex - "code" -> "odce", "dceo"

Input:
    Tact Coa
Output:
    True (taco cat, atco cta)

Let's break this problem up into two portions.
    1st - Palindrome portion
        Because it has to be a palindrome, we know that the string must have "matching" chars, and at most only one char can have an odd count
    2nd - Permutation
        A permutation is just a rearrangement of letters - if we know a string is a palindrome -> we already know it's a permutation
        This is because the string backwards is a "rearrangement" of the letters
    So then - we can use a dictionary to loop through the string and count the occurences of each "char"
    After that - we can loop through the dictionary to see if there is more than one char that has only one occurence - if there's more than one
    char that has one occurence - return False - not a palindrome
    -> If there is only one char that has one occurence - return True
